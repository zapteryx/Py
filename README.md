Hobby project written by people who have no idea what they're doing.

## Database
This project uses MySQL 8. It is **not tested** with any version below and will not be supported.

While not required for general usage of the bot, a database is required for certain cogs.

If not present, the affected cogs will simply not load. 

Simply delete all lines relating to MySQL in your `.env` to disable the use of a database.
