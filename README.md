hobby project written by people who have no idea what they're doing.

## Database
this project uses MySQL 8. it is **not tested** with any version below and will not be supported.

while not required for general usage of the bot, a database is required for certain cogs.

if not present, the affected cogs will simply not load. 

simply delete all lines relating to MySQL in your `.env` to disable the use of a database.
